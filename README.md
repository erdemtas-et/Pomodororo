# Pomodororo

Pomodoro Timer with a *simple* User Interface.

## Intro

I got help from the [CLTypingLabel](https://github.com/cl7/CLTypingLabel) to make the typing animation.

## User Interface

I have added ***three options*** the users can choose from. Also, to keep track of time, there is a progress bar instead of a standard countdown timer.

## Functionality

After the user chooses one of the ***time*** option, the progress bar starts working immediately.

### TIME IS UP!
When the time is up, the user gets an alert box with sound. It is important to take a break in Pomodoro Technique. Alert box is there to remind the user of the importance of breaks.
